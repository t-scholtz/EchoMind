 Make a list of Monopoly's flaws and you'll realize just how bad it is. It's mostly luck-based, there's lots of winning on other players, there's a big lull before Monopoly's little trading ever happens, balances rare, and the outcome is clear early on. So if you dislike Monopoly, I can't blame you.
